To compact an Oracle database, open the Enterprise Manager (EM) browser-based client:


First ensure the Windows Service is running:
Name has DBConsole in it
e.g. OracleDBConsoleorcl


Then from the windows start menu, follow a path like this one:
Start > Oracle - OraDb11g_home1 > Database Control - orcl


The link should open the web browser with a URL ending with "/em", e.g.
https://localhost:1158/em


The username and password (for the Cambridge Assessment image):

[Insufficient privileges]
Username: cadev
Password: [usual]

[GOD MODE]
Username: system
Password: [usual]


Drill down to find the Segement Advisor:
Upper-right corner "Database" tab > Home tab > Space Summary section > Segment Advisor Recommendations

?
[omitting some steps here] I ran a job via EM to alter things via the Segment Advisor,
I watched the job run until it finished, the history said it was successful, but the 
dashboard alerts didn't decrease...

?







To connect using the Oracle SQL Developer client:

Windows start button > Oracle - OraDb11g_home1 > Application Development > SQL Developer

Press the New Connection icon/button.
Give it the creds:
Username: system
Password: [usual]
The SID: to locate the SID, open Windows Services, locate the service starting with OracleDBConsole
	The SID is the suffix. e.g. "OracleDBConcsoleorcl" has an SID of "orcl"
-That should be it!
