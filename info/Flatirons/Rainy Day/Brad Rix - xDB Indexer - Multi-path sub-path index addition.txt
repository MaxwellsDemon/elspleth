I thought of another performance enhancement feature for the Indexer relating to Multi-Path indexes.  I suspect this one does not exist yet.

For multi-path indexes, if there are only changes to one of the sub-paths (additions/changes/deletions), then those can be individually added/deleted without having to rebuild the entire multi-path index.

Hence, the main use case is if someone has  multi-path index (Paul had one today for this situation) where he wanted to just add an additional couple of paths, then the indexer would only need to add those paths.

Just a thought for the future.
