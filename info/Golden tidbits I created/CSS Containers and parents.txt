Say you have lots of divs containing divs. 


You want to position a small div in a corner of its parent div like so:


+---------+
|         |
|         |
|         |
|     +--+|
|     |  ||
|     +--+|
+---------+

Usually the small div will be relative to the body or some ancestor, ignoring the parent div. <-- UNDESIRABLE

This happens because the parent div is statically positioned, which is the default.
To keep the parent div in the document flow but it have it act like a true container, 
use position: relative on the parent div.
