We found this "resolution path" is used by Class.getResouce():

"C:\code\CCMSCommon\test\java"

Which happens to be one of the two paths specificed in Eclipse > Java Build Path > Source tab > the root entries.
	Happy coincidence? I'm not sure.
The two source folders are in Eclipse are:

CCMSCommon/src/java
CCMSCommon/test/java

Thoughts:
-I'm unsure if both source paths are scanned, which is a different approach than using exactly one path for resolution

-Definitely the resolution path is the parent directory of the root package directory. So if "com" is your root package, it is "com/.."
	-This rule suggests the resolution path ends with the directory name "src", "test", or "classes"
	-This rule produces these possible resolution paths:
		CCMSCommon/src/java
		CCMSCommon/test/java
		CCMSCommon/bin/classes
		CCMSCommon/bin/test/classes

-Through trial and error the root directory is not in the output "/bin" directory. This is weird
	because the running JUnit uses compiled .class files under the output "/bin" directory
