
Eclipse on Linux the Javadoc popups have a black background, making text hard to read, 
especially blue hyperlinks.  
The solution is to change the popup rendered to Webkit (as an embedded browser in eclipse).
Part of the problem is using the GTK3 widget library, which has more bugs and is slower than GTK2.

1) Create a Bash startup script for Eclipse in its home directory:

#!/bin/bash
# Force Eclipse to use GWT2, to work around slow vertical scrolling bug
export SWT_GTK3=0
cd `dirname $0`
./eclipse


2) Add the following VM flag to <eclipse_home>/eclipse.ini
	-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=webkit

3) Install the webkitgtk package
	sudo yum install webkitgtk

Restart Eclipse and Javadoc popups should have a white background.
