1) Set place holder Git name/email
from:
git config --global user.name "Curtis Fleming"
git config --global user.email "Curtis.Fleming@flatironssolutions.com"

to:
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "John.Doe@flatironssolutions.com"


2) Editor cleanup
Oxygen: close all open files (so they do not reopen)
Eclipse: close file editors, clear breakpoints, clear expressions
Eclipse: change Javadoc @author to "Flatirons Developer" from "Curtis Fleming"


3) Desktop cleanup
Clean desktop by moving custom files to the sandbox directory



4) Steps to create a smaller VM

--- Most important step -----------------------

	Delete ALL VM snapshots. Little point in any of this space cleanup
		if keeping a snapshot, becuase they prevent VM compact...

--- File cleanup ------------------------------

	Clear Chrome history
	Clear Firefox history

	Empty recycling bin

	Run "git gc" for each git repository
	Run "mvn clean" for each Maven project
		See script tidy.sh to find such projects and clean them

	Run The IAUtils GWT cleanup script

	As developer	delete ~/.cache/
	As root		delete ~/.cache/

	Occasionally run "sudo baobab /" to graphically review disk usage
		for unneeded large files and directories to delete.
		(A lot like the Windows equivalent of "WinDirStat" tool)

--- Reclaim freed space -----------------------

	As root run ~/linux-vm-compact-prep_zero-out-empty-space.sh
		Only run this if all VM snapshots are deleted

	"Compact" (VMware utility) the POWERED DOWN image's volume.
		Only run this if all VM snapshots are deleted

--- Compress the VM ---------------------------

	On the host OS, use 7-Zip to archive the VM directory
	Settings:
		Archive format:		7z
		Compression level:	Ultra
		Compression method:	LZMA2
		
		(remaining settings use default values)
