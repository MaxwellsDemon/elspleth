I think this is how to create a [Java interface]-[property file] mapping in GWT:
In the java file, import this type:
	import com.google.gwt.i18n.client.Constants;
Then extend it as an interface:
	public interface CcmsProperties extends Constants { ... }
There is still gray area around the package of the java file and the property file.
