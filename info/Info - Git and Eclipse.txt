Use Git global user name as Java class file @author tag in Eclipse:
Preferences > Java > Code Style > Code Templates > Comments > Types

Template:

/**
 * 
 * @author ${name:git_config(user.name)}
 */


 
 
Delete branch, not sure if it is remote or remote+local... good luck.
git push origin --delete <branchName>
