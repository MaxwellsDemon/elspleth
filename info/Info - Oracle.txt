Installing oracle by default does not reveal its port externally,
which is a super duper feature.

Jim Monaco gave me a file called "tnsnames.ora" for reference, and essentially
just google the issue and in a similar or nearly similar file
in the Oracle installation directory, add a config line with the static IP
of the machine you want to be externally accessible.  There will already be a 
line containing localhost.


	tnsnames.ora:

SISI =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.8.242.100)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = sisi)
    )
  )
