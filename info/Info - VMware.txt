To reclaim VMDK space on the host for a linux gest OS, do these steps:

https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-shrink-vmware-virtual-disk-files-vmdk

In short:

Run this on the guest linux OS to create a big file of all zeros, to clean empty space:
cat /dev/zero > zero.fill;sync;sleep 1;sync;rm -f zero.fill

Shut down VM

Then something like this:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\vmware-vdiskmanager.exe" -k <path to VMDK>

It performs a shrink.


Historical values: CentOS7 image where host reported 43 GB and guest reported 21 GB
Result was 27GB.
