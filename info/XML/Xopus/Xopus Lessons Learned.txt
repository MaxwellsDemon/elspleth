Xopus lessons learned.

XopusBeforeAttrInserted is misleading because the attribute has already been cleared and .cancelEvent will not prevent 
the clear, only prevent the assignment to the new value.


Fault 1
Instantiating <x:template> and surfacing that in the events.  As a library user I am not expecting this and it effectively
causes incorrect events to fire.

Fault 2
Having the element created and stomped on by <x:template> without a cancelable event, which means I cannot enforce
a set-once pattern for attributes.
